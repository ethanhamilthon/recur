// ToolDescription is the bash tool contract sent to the model. It has two parts:
// the short shell rules, then a block that tells the agent what Recur is and
// which topic owns each subject. Everything longer lives in the topics.
const ToolDescription = `Run a command in system Bash (/bin/bash --noprofile --norc). Each call starts a
fresh process in the project directory; variables, functions, aliases and working
directory changes do not persist between calls. External programs run from PATH
with the user's permissions. There is no TTY and stdin is empty.
Result: {output, exit_code}. Stdout and stderr are merged. max_output: bytes kept
(null uses the configured default; 0 disables truncation; the middle is cut with a notice).
timeout: seconds (null uses the configured default; the schema states the maximum).
A timeout (exit 124) or cancellation (exit 130) kills the command's process group.
Prefer filtering with rg, grep, head, tail, sed -n or wc. Create files with a quoted heredoc.
Long-running work: redirect stdout and stderr to a file and notify on completion.
Background processes are not persistent session jobs.
Recur commands (ordinary programs, also usable from scripts and background jobs):
- recur notify TEXT... (or stdin): send a <notify> message to this session. An idle agent starts a turn; a busy one receives it as steering.
- recur view PATH...: queue PNG/JPEG images for the next model request (at most four wait).
- recur docs [TOPIC]: print built-in documentation.
Every call exports RECUR_SESSION_ID, RECUR_MODEL, RECUR_PROVIDER, RECUR_EFFORT,
RECUR_CTX_SIZE (latest request input tokens, empty if unknown) and RECUR_ENDPOINT
(session socket). The full variable list is in the cli topic.
The shell is not an OS security sandbox; do not perform destructive actions unless requested.

About Recur
Recur is the minimal coding-agent harness that runs you. Its behavior is set ONLY by recur.toml:
- Project file: ./recur.toml in the launch directory (no upward search). Global file: $RECUR_HOME/recur.toml (default ~/.recur/recur.toml). --config PATH selects the primary file instead.
- Files merge over built-in defaults; unknown keys fail startup. Apply edits with /reload in the TUI (the active provider, model and effort are kept).
- BEFORE editing recur.toml or answering questions about Recur, run: recur docs config (every key, default, constraint, and the hooks pointer).
- recur docs index lists all topics. Key topics:
  config: precedence, merge rules, keys
  hooks: lifecycle events, hook behavior, delivery
  cli: commands, flags, RECUR_* variables, exit codes
  cookbook: recipes, sub-agents, headless driver
  headless: the --mode jsonl protocol
  runtime: shell tool details
  sessions: storage, commands, locks
  troubleshooting: startup and config errors, log files
  update: recur update and the update check`
